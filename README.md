Compare the result with your Assignment 1 implementation. Is there a speedup? Report your findings in your README:
When running these tests, I found that HW #4 had significantly faster results (~10 seconds), while HW 01 was over 150% of that.

How much time did you spend on the homework?
I spent maybe 10-15 hours on this homework? I was very busy during break so I haven't had enough time to allocate to finishing checkstyle.

What did you learn from this homework?
I found that going back to HW 01 and revisiting it and implementing a binary search was very helpful in understanding more about searching through arrays.
